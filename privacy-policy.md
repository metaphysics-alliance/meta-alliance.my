# Privacy Policy
**Last Updated:** October 19, 2025
This notice explains how Metaphysics Alliance collects, uses, stores, and shares personal data across consultations, audits, events, and digital products. It also summarises the rights available to you under the Personal Data Protection Act 2010 (Malaysia).

## Summary
- **Coverage:** Applies to clients, prospects, workshop participants, and visitors engaging with Metaphysics Alliance services, reports, events, and digital platforms.
- **Regulation:** We comply with the Personal Data Protection Act 2010 (Malaysia) and honour contractual commitments for cross-border engagements.
- **Support:** Direct privacy questions to support@meta-alliance.my. Critical incidents are escalated within 24 hours.

## 1. Who we are & scope

Metaphysics Alliance (meta-alliance.my) is the data controller for personal data we collect when you interact with our team, receive services, purchase digital products, or visit our sites.

- **When we act as controller:** We determine the purpose and means of processing when you submit data through enquiry forms, booking requests, payments, events, or audits that we initiate. We decide how long that data is retained and which safeguards apply.
- **When we act as processor:** For enterprise engagements we may handle staff or customer data supplied by you. We only use that information to deliver the contracted work, follow your documented instructions, and delete or return the data once the work concludes.

**Note:** By engaging us you confirm that any third-party data you supply was collected lawfully and that you have authority to share it.

## 2. Personal data we collect

We operate on the principle of data minimisation—collecting only what is required to deliver accurate readings, audits, and support.

- **Identity & contact details:** Name, preferred honorific, email, phone number, company information, billing address, and communication preferences.
- **Consultation inputs:** Birth details (date, time, place), floor plans, team structures, business metrics, questionnaires, and other materials you provide so that we can perform calculations and design recommendations.
- **Operational & transaction data:** Service history, booking information, invoices, payment confirmations (processed via secure gateways), support enquiries, session notes, and follow-up actions.
- **Website & systems data:** Language preference cookies, device metadata, and anonymised analytics generated through privacy-filtered tools. We do not run behavioural advertising or sell your browsing history.

**Note:** Where sensitive personal data (for example, health indicators or family circumstances) is relevant to your consultation, we rely on your explicit consent and restrict internal access to authorised consultants only.

## 3. How we use personal data

We rely on contract performance, legitimate interests, legal obligations, and consent (where required) to process personal data.

- **Deliver readings, audits, and programmes:** Preparing charts, analytics, written reports, digital dashboards, and briefings; scheduling sessions; tailoring recommendations to your objectives.
  - Legal basis: Legal basis: contract performance & legitimate interests.
- **Client support & communications:** Responding to enquiries, sharing progress updates, sending resource materials, and providing post-engagement follow-up when you request it.
  - Legal basis: Legal basis: legitimate interests & consent (for optional updates).
- **Operations & finance:** Billing, accounting, record keeping, fraud prevention, and verifying identity or authority where mandated.
  - Legal basis: Legal basis: legal obligation & legitimate interests.
- **Compliance & risk management:** Investigating complaints, enforcing agreements, protecting intellectual property, and responding to lawful requests from authorities.
  - Legal basis: Legal basis: legal obligation & legitimate interests.

## 4. Retention & security

We maintain structured retention schedules so data is stored only for as long as it remains useful or legally required.

- **Retention windows:** Core client files and invoices are stored for seven (7) years to satisfy PDPA and accounting requirements. Prospect enquiries with no follow-up are deleted after 18 months. Raw analysis inputs—floor plans, spreadsheets, recordings—are purged within 90 days of project sign-off unless you request an extended archive.
- **Security controls:** Safeguards include encrypted storage, role-based access, secure portals for large files, mandatory confidentiality agreements, and annual security reviews with documented remediation plans.
  - Production systems are hosted in ISO 27001-certified environments.
  - Portable devices are protected with full-disk encryption and biometric access.
  - Data shared with consultants uses expiring links or vetted collaboration suites.

## 5. Sharing & international transfers

We never sell personal data. Transfers occur only when necessary to deliver services or comply with the law.

- **Vetted processors:** We engage payment gateways, secure cloud storage, analytics, transcription, and communication providers located in Malaysia, Singapore, or jurisdictions with comparable safeguards. Each provider signs a PDPA-aligned data processing agreement.
- **Cross-border processing:** When tools process data outside Malaysia, we ensure contractual clauses mandate equivalent protection and enable audits if required.

- We disclose personal data when compelled by law, court order, or governmental authority, and we document each disclosure.
- If Metaphysics Alliance undergoes a merger or acquisition, you will be notified before data is transferred and given the opportunity to opt out where applicable.

## 6. Your rights & preferences

### You may exercise the following rights:
- Request access to the personal data we hold about you.
- Ask for corrections to inaccurate or incomplete data.
